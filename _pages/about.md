Hi there, I am Zhanke Zhou, currently a second-year Ph.D. student at Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning (TMLR) Group in the Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, advised by Dr. [Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/), and work closely with Dr. [Quanming Yao](https://lars-group.github.io/).

My research interests lie in trustworthy machine learning, particularly in machine reasoning with structure data and foundation models, as well as its applications in scientific discoveries, e.g., math, biology, and chemistry.

I am always open to possible collaborations. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:cszkzhou@comp.hkbu.edu.hk)!
